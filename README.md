Zf2 Module for ElFinder
============== 
This module attempts to provide an integration layer between Zend Framework 2
and ElFinder.

Currently this module provides the configuration for routing to elfinder through
the following path `http://yourdomain.com/elfinder` and the connector is
located by default at `http://yourdomain.com/elfinder/connector`.  All of this
can be changed via configuration.

Also included are the needed hooks for CKEditor and TinyMce.

##IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE
This module DOES NOT provide any user authentication and if used on
it's own will grant anyone access to your public file system! It is expected
that through ZF2 you will be setting up your own authentication and user
management system.  For that reason this module has no plans for including any.
But if you need authentication you may want to check out the ZfUser module and
see if that works for you.

## Change Log
v2.0.2
  * Fixed BC break from upstream.  Js and Css are now already merged
  * Added pulling configs from the Service Locator for more complex configurations.  See docs below

v2.0.1
  * Removed the @dev dependancy on ElFinder.

v2.0.0-alpha
  * Added composer definition to use upstream ElFinder package instead of using our own.
  * Added [Asset Manager](https://github.com/RWOverdijk/AssetManager) module as a
    dependency to handle building the needed JS and CSS files.
  * Cleaned up views
  
Please report any bugs you find.


## Requirements
[PHP 5.4+](http://php.net/)
[Zend Framework 2](http://www.github.com/zendframework/zf2)

## Installation
This package uses composer to install.

#### Installation steps

  1. Install the composer package: `composer require reliv/elfinder`

  2. Add 'Reliv\ElFinder' (and AssetManager) to your list of modules in `[zf2 project folder]/config/application.config.php`

  3. (Optional) Configure the module for use in your project (see configuration
     below)

  4. (Optional) Add ElFinder finder to your views that need it.

  5. Test it out and report any bugs or issues back to the project.

  6. Tell others about it.


## Adding ElFinder to your project

#### Stand Alone
If just wanting to test out or use ElFinder as a standalone File Manager,
simply navigate your browser to the standalone route for ElFinder.  If your
using the defaults this URL is `http://yourdomain.com/elfinder/standalone`

#### CkEditor
To add ElFinder to CKEditor add the route to the explore window to
 CkEditors config.  This can be done when your initializing your editor or
simply by adding this to the CkEditor's global config file.  By default the
config file is located in CkEditors main folder `path/to/ckeditor/config.js`.

Add the following lines to CkEditor's config

```javascript
    filebrowserBrowseUrl : '/elfinder/ckeditor',
    filebrowserImageBrowseUrl : '/elfinder/ckeditor/images',
```

Note:  If you've changed the default routes to ElFinder, be sure to point the
code above to the correct place.


Optionally you can customize CkEditors popup window size to fit your needs
by adding the following line to CkEditors config and adjusting to your taste.

```javascript
    filebrowserWindowHeight : '400',
    filebrowserWindowWidth : '800'
```

#### TinyMce
To add ElFinder to TinyMce copy the 'public/tinymce/plugins/elfinder'
to your TinyMce instance plugins folder.

Register the plugin with TinyMce.

```javascript
    tinymce.init({
        ....
        plugins: 'elfinder',
        ....
    });
```


#### Using in your own application
This module can be used as a file uploader or to pick an existing file from
existing mount points.  In order to do that your program will need to open
up a popup window that points to the ElFinder's explorer window.  In addition
to that, the calling window MUST have a global javascript function defined.

The following is an example that you might add to your page:

```javascript
<script type="javascript">
function elFinderFileSelected(filePath) {
    // Do something with the file path returned.
}

function showElFinder(elFinderExplorerPath, windowWidth, windowHeight) {
    window.open(
        elFinderExplorerPath,
        '',
        'resizable=yes,
        location=no,
        menubar=no,
        scrollbars=yes,
        status=no,
        toolbar=no,
        fullscreen=no,
        dependent=no,
        width=windowWidth,
        height=windowHeight,
        status'
    );
}
</script>
```

## Configuration (Optional)

This module uses basic ZF2 configuration and passes this information on to
ElFinder.  All [server connector options](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options)
are available to you but because there's not a one size fits all to this
we've extended this just a little so you can have additional or specific
settings based on your needs.

This module comes with some pre-defined configuration to get you up and running
as quickly as possible.  *Please Note: To use default configuration the contents
of the public folder for this modules must be located in
`[project home]/public/modules/el-finder`.  In other words `modules/el-finder`
must be publicly accessible.


####Configuring Mount Points

By default the system sets up two default mount points for you,
`[project home]/public/modules/el-finder/files` and
`[project home]/public/modules/el-finder/files/images` however there is no
limit to how many mount points you can define.

To add a new mount point simply open up your application config or projects
global config file and add your mount points like so.

```php
return array(
    'elfinder' => array(
        'mounts' => array(
            'defaults' => array(
                'myNewMountPoint' => array (
                    //Mount point definition goes here.
                    //Minimum config below.  See ElFinders "Connector
                    //configuration options" for more info
                    'roots' => array(
                        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',
                        'path'   => '/path/to/files/',
                        'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```
For a full list of all mount point configuration settings please see ElFinders
wiki page titled [Connector configuration options](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Connector-configuration-options)\


####Configuration Services

Some of the newer volume drivers require some complex configuration that can't be cached.  As such you can provide
your own Service Config that will be pulled out of the Service Manager instead of the config array.

These configuration services MUST implement the Reliv\ElFinder\Config\ConfigInterface and return a valid
ElFinder mount config as seen in the above example.  In addition this service must be able to be initiated from
the Service Manager, so it will need to be defined there as well.

To define a Configuration Service for a mount point, here's a modified version of the config above.

```php
return array(
    'elfinder' => array(
        'mounts' => array(
            'defaults' => array(
                'myNewMountPoint' => array (
                    //Service Config goes here
                    'configService' => 'MyServiceHere'
                ),
            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```


####Configuring the Zf2 routes

There are four routes defined by default.

    `/elfinder` - Main route to open the explorer window which will pass
                  back the url for the file selected to the calling window.

    `/elfinder/connector` - Route to ElFinders php connector
    `/elfinder/standalone` - Route to standalone window.  This has no callback
                             and can be used by itself to manage the filesystem

    `/elfinder/ckeditor` - Hook for CKEditor


All of these routes can be customized based on your preferences.  To overwrite
these routes open up your application or project config and define the following
routes as needed:

```php
return array(
    'router' => array(
        'routes' => array (
            'elFinder' => array( // route definition goes here // ),
            'elFinderConnector' => array( // route definition goes here // ),
            'elFinderStandAlone' => array( // route definition goes here // ),
            'elFinderCkEditor' => array( // route definition goes here // ),
        ),
    ),
);
```

Important:  Please note that if you change the route for the connector you
will need to add the following lines to your application or project configuration
files:

```php
return array(
    'elfinder' => array(
        'connectorPath' => 'path/to/connector',
    )
);
```



####Additional Special configuration

This module is setup to understand and respect different configurations, mount
points, and settings based your needs.  This is done all through configuration.
As an example CKEditor uses a special flag for uploading Images.  So for
that we have setup an images folder that only allows images to uploaded.

To setup a different configuration you'll want to open up your application or
project config files and add the following:

```php
return array(
    'elfinder' => array(
        'mounts' => array(

            //Set Name for this configuration
            'myNewFileTypeOrConfigName' => array(

                //Mount point definition goes here.
                //Minimum config below.  See ElFinders "Connector
                //configuration options" for more info

                'myNewMountPoint' => array (
                    //Mount point definition goes here.
                    //Minimum config below.  See ElFinders "Connector
                    //configuration options" for more info
                    'roots' => array(
                        'driver' => 'LocalFileSystem',
                        'path'   => '/path/to/files/',
                        'URL'    => 'http://localhost/to/files/'
                    ),
                ),

            ),
        ),
    ),
);
```

Once that's complete, setup your view for ElFinder as described above, with
one exception.  You need to add your new definition or type to the URL or route
to ElFinder.   If using the example above my new URL this instance of ElFinder
would be `/elfinder/images`





##To Do
Setup MySql connector to use Zend DB or at least pass in the current DB settings
to ElFinders MySql connector class.

Setup MySql connector to use Doctrine ORM Module or at least pass in the current
DB settings when using Doctrine.
